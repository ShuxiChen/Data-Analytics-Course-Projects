# Syllabus and Final Project Requirement

## Overview

This course covers a wide range of data analysis techniques, including data collection, data processing, and data analysis. The mission of this project was to apply these techniques to open data scraped from government house price websites and present the findings. While the base dataset for all students was related to house prices, students had the flexibility to explore specific research questions or topics of interest, allowing them to combine additional datasets for a more comprehensive analysis.

## Techniques Covered

1. **Data Collection**
   - Data Extraction
   - Web Scraping

2. **Data Processing**
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Data Preprocessing

3. **Data Analysis**
   - Data Visualization
   - Machine Learning Models (including training, evaluation, and optimization)

## Final Project Mission

Each student was required to use open data collected from government house price websites and apply the learned techniques for their final project presentation. While the base dataset was focused on house prices, students had the flexibility to explore various aspects of the data or address specific research questions.

The project outcomes varied from student to student based on their chosen research topics and objectives.
