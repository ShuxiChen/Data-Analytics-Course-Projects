# Syllabus and Final Project Description
This course aims to apply machine learning techniques to the analysis of marketing data.Use supervised learning and unsupervised learning algorithms of machine learning, and use Python to deeply analyze business data inside or outside the network to assist companies in formulating data-based marketing strategies.

## Techniques Covered

1. **Data Collection**
   - Data Extraction
   - Web Scraping

2. **Data Processing**
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Data Preprocessing

3. **Data Analysis**
   - Data Visualization
   - Machine Learning Models (including training, evaluation, and optimization)

## Final Project requirements

Each student was required to use open data collected from government house price websites and apply the learned techniques for their final project presentation. 

While the base dataset was focused on house prices, students had the flexibility to explore various aspects of the data or address specific research questions.

So, the project outcomes varied from student to student based on their chosen research topics and objectives.
