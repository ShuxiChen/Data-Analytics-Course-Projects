# Interval Estimation
To provide a range or interval of values within which the true population parameter is likely to fall. It allows to quantify the uncertainty associated with estimates.

* Significance Level

  The significance level (Î±) is the probability of making a Type I error, which is the error of incorrectly rejecting a null hypothesis when it is actually true.

### Confidence Interval (CI)

**Purpose:**
A Confidence Interval (CI) is a range of values that is calculated from sample data and is used to estimate an unknown population parameter with a specified level of confidence. It provides an interval estimate for the true parameter value, such as the population mean, proportion, or standard deviation.

**Key Features:**
- Provides a range of values within which the true parameter is likely to fall.
- Typically expressed with a confidence level (e.g., 95%) representing the probability that the interval contains the true parameter.

### Prediction Interval (PI)

**Purpose:**
A Prediction Interval (PI) is used to estimate a range of values for a future observation or data point from the same population. Unlike a Confidence Interval, a Prediction Interval accounts for both the uncertainty of parameter estimation and the variability of individual observations.

**Key Features:**
- Provides a range of values within which a future data point is likely to fall.
- Typically wider than a Confidence Interval due to the additional variability consideration.

### Tolerance Interval (TI)

**Purpose:**
A Tolerance Interval (TI) is used to specify a range of values within which a certain proportion (or percentage) of the population data is expected to fall. It is often used in quality control to ensure that a certain percentage of items produced meet specified criteria.

**Key Features:**
- Specifies both a confidence level and a coverage percentage (e.g., 95% of the data falls within the interval with 99% confidence).
- Commonly used in manufacturing and industrial applications to ensure product quality.
