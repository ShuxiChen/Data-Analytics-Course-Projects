# Convex Hull

## Mission

In a two-dimensional plane, place N points and find a convex polygon that encloses all the points, with its vertices being a subset of the given points.
* **Input:** N points, each with randomly generated X and Y coordinates.
* **Output:** Graphical user interface for visualizing the convex hull.

## Papaer Report

The report for this project should include the following sections:

1. **Methodology**: Explain how the experiment was conducted, including details on generating random numbers, running sorting algorithms, and measuring time.

2. **Graphical Results**: Present the line graphs showing the average time taken by each sorting algorithm for different input sizes.

3. **Discussion**: Analyze the results and provide insights into the performance of each sorting algorithm. Discuss any trends or observations.

4. **Challenges and Solutions**: Describe any difficulties encountered during the project and how they were resolved.
