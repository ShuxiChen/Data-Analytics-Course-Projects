# Sorting Algorithm Performance Analysis

This project involves the analysis of sorting algorithm performance for different input sizes. Five sorting algorithms, namely **Bubble Sort**, **Selection Sort**, **Insertion Sort**, **Quick Sort**, and **Heap Sort**, are analyzed. The input sizes considered are N = 50000, 100000, 150000, 200000, 250000, and 300000 random numbers. The number of repetitions for each N value is set to 25.

## Mission

1. Generate random lists of N numbers for each of the specified input sizes.
2. Implement the following sorting algorithms:
    - Bubble Sort
    - Selection Sort
    - Insertion Sort
    - Quick Sort
    - Heap Sort
3. For each input size, run each sorting algorithm 25 times on different random lists.
4. Measure and record the time taken by each sorting algorithm for each run (excluding the time for generating random numbers).
5. Calculate the average time taken for each algorithm at each input size.
6. Plot line graphs to visualize the performance of each sorting algorithm for the six input sizes.
7. Create a consolidated graph to compare the performance of all sorting algorithms across different input sizes.
